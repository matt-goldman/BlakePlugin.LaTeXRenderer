## Hello world!

Hello. This is a test page, generated by the Blake Blazor static site generator. Like it?

:::tip
Blake supports markdown containers, like this tip. It comes with some built-in Bootstrap styles (compatible with the default Blazor template):

* Exercise
* Warning
* Tip
* Info

Use it like this:
```markdown
   :::tip
   This is a tip container.
   :::
```

You can disable these if you don't want to use them.
:::

:::my
You can also wrap anything in a Razor component, like this custom container. By specifying a container name (note it must be in camelCase), you can create custom containers.
```markdown
    :::myContainer
    This is a custom container.
    :::
```
Blake will render this as:

```razor
   <MyContainer>
       This is a custom container.
   </MyContainer>
```

The rest is up to Blazor - just make sure you have a component named `MyContainer` in your project, with a `RenderFragment` parameter for the content.
You can see the example `MyContainer` component that was generated by Blake in the `Components` folder of this project.

## Math tests

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{O}{H}
$$

* **C**os(θ) = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{A}{H}
$$

* **T**an(θ) = **O**pposite / **A**djacent

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{O}{A}
$$

$ \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 $

## FAQ

1. Why?

I...honestly can't remember!

2. What's next?

Templating system...other features...I forget. I have a roadmap though.

3. How do I use it?

Eventually it will be a standalone CLI tool, you'll be able to use it like this:

```bash
blake init
blake bake
dotnet run
```

or

```bash
blake init
blake serve
```

## Roadmap

```bash
blake new --template my-template
blake new -t a-different-template
```
